      <h2>History</h2>
      <img src="./assets/history.jpg" alt="Image from 1930 WC" width="50%" />
      <p>
        The world's first international football match was a challenge match
        played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England. The first
        international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home
        Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in
        other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held
        as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904
        Summer Olympics (however, the International Olympic Committee has
        retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906
        Intercalated Games.
      </p>
      <p>
        After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international
        football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in
        Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international
        football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as
        having been a failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official
        competition. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's
        football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was
        regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain
        (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold
        medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Trophy</h2>
      <img src="./assets/cup.jpg" alt="Image of Trophy" width="50%" />
      <p>
        From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the winning
        team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde,
        but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set
        up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the
        tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the
        trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently
        melted down by the thieves.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was
        designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated
        the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian
        designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36 cm (14.2 in) high, made
        of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175 kg (13.6 lb).The base
        contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of
        the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup
        winner since 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World
        Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is
        finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid
        gold original immediately afterwards.

      <h2>Format</h2>
      <img src="./assets/format.jpg" alt="WC Format" width="50%" />

      <p>
        <b>Qualification:</b>
        Since the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been
        held to thin the field for the final tournament.They are held within the
        six FIFA continental zones ,overseen by their respective confederations.
        For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each
        of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative
        strength of the confederations' teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Final tournament:</b>
        The current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32
        national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations.
        There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the <i>group stage</i>, teams compete within eight groups of four
        teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other
        seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings
        or performances in recent World Cups. Each group plays a round-robin
        tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against
        other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches
        are played within a group.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>knockout stage </i>is a single-elimination tournament in which teams
        play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty
        shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the
        round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group
        plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the
        quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the
        losing semi-finalists), and the final.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Hosts</h2>
      <img src="./assets/World_cup_hosts2.png" alt="Host Map" width="60%" />
      <p>
        The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done
        under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of
        a country desiring to host the event receives a "Hosting Agreement" from
        FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a
        strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission
        of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After
        this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to
        identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the
        event and a report on the country is produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven
        years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions
        where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the
        same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were
        awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle
        Eastern country to host the tournament.

        The World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely
        viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative
        viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be
        26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of the
        tournament, almost a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The
        2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into
        groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many
        sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. Host countries
        typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the
        month-long event. The governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8
        billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament, and $6.1 billion from the
        2018 tournament.

        Each FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. World Cup
        Willie, the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup
        mascot.[91] World Cups feature official match balls specially designed
        for each tournament. After Slazenger produced the ball for the 1966
        World Cup Adidas became the official supplier to FIFA.[92] Each World
        Cup also has an official song, which have been performed by artists
        ranging from Shakira to Will Smith.[93][94] Other songs, such as “Nessun
        dorma”, performed by The Three Tenors at four World Cup concerts, have
        also become identified with the tournament.[95]

      <p>
        Having refereed a World Cup Final and still being alive to recount their
        experience is exceptionally rare. Numerically speaking, there is a
        similarly small group of Supreme Court justices or astronauts to have
        orbited the moon. The referee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final, will
        become just the ninth person alive to be able to narrate their
        impression.

      <p>
        The assistant video assistant referee (AVAR) is a current or former
        referee appointed to assist the VAR in the video operation room. The
        responsibilities of the AVAR include watching the live action on the
        field while the VAR is undertaking a "check" or a "review", to keep a
        record of reviewable incidents, and to communicate the outcome of a
        review to broadcasters.
